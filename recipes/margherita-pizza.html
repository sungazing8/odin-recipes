            <p><h2>Cooking method</h2></p>
           
            <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, 
                then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, 
                pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring 
                together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, 
                fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface 
                and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea 
                towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if 
                you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
            
            <li>
                Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic 
                together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room 
                temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
            
            <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give 
                it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured 
                surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm 
                across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very 
                thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto 
                two floured baking sheets.</li>
            
            <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put 
                another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the 
                oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the 
                back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, 
                drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, 
                still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet 
                or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a 
                little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. 
                Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
